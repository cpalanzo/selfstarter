          <summary>What is a "Backer"? What do you mean by "Pre-Launch Special"?</summary>
          <p>"Backers" are our supporters who shell out money to help us finish and launch the full product. Backers get a t-shirt and a special graphic symbol on their profile in return for there support.
          </p>
          <p> Our "Pre-Launch" special allows us to "hit the ground running". When you, along with a few thousand other musicians sign up you get a special low 1-year subscriptoin rate. When we launch the app all the Pre-Launch members get notified and have their accounts setup for use, the system comes up live with lots and lots of people from day 1.</p>

          <summary>When will the service be live? What is pre-buy?</summary>
          <p>We are using this site and your interest to finish the creation and launch of To The Gig. It's like our own version of Kickstarter. We have 95% of the technology working, but we don't want to launch until we have a few thousand members ready to go! That's what makes our site valuable. <br /><br />As of January 2016 we have almost 2,000 musicians raring to go! Join us. Right now we are planning a full application launch in September of 2016</p>
